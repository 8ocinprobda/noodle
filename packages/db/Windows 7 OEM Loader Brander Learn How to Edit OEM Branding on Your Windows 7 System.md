# How to Customize Your Windows 7 PC with OEM Brander
 
If you want to personalize your Windows 7 PC with your own logo, make, model and support information, you might be interested in a free portable application called OEM Brander. This tool allows you to edit the OEM branding on a Windows 7 PC without any installation or activation required.
 
OEM branding is the information that appears in the System Properties window when you right-click on Computer and select Properties. It usually shows the manufacturer's logo, name, model and support contact details. OEM Brander lets you change this information to anything you want, as well as the Performance Index logo and the Media Center logo.

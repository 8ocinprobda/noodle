Ddl and Dts Connect are two technologies that allow you to enjoy surround sound from your PC or game console through your home theater system. They encode the PC's multi-channel audio into a Dolby Digital or DTS bitstream and output it from the sound card's digital out (S/PDIF), via a single digital cable into your home theater receiver. This way, you can experience realistic 5.1-channel sound effects during interactive video gameplay or media playback.
 
However, to use these technologies, you need to have a valid activation key that comes with the Creative Dolby Digital Live and DTS Connect Pack. This pack is compatible with certain Sound Blaster X-Fi audio devices that have a digital out port. If you have purchased this pack, you should have received an email with the activation key and a download link for the installation file. If you have lost or deleted this email, you can still download the installation file from [here](https://www.scribd.com/document/194548259/Dolby-Digital-Live-and-DTS-Connect-Key), but you will need to contact Creative customer support to retrieve your activation key.

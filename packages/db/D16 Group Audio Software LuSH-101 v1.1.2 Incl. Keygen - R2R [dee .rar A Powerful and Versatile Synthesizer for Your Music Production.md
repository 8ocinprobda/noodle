LuSH-101 has eight independent layers, each with its own polyphony, parameters, arpeggiator, and effects. You can assign the layers to the same or different MIDI channels, or split them across the keyboard for more flexibility. You can also layer them together for massive and lush sounds that can fill any mix.
 
Each layer of LuSH-101 has a powerful synthesis engine that consists of two oscillators, a sub-oscillator, a noise generator, a multimode filter, an amplifier, and two LFOs and envelopes. You can choose from various waveforms, filter types, modulation sources, and routing options to shape your sound exactly as you want. You can also use the unison mode to add more depth and width to your sound.
 
LuSH-101 also comes with a built-in mixer that lets you adjust the volume, pan, EQ, and compression of each layer. You can also use three send effects to add reverb, delay, or chorus to your sound. The effects are of high quality and can enhance your sound without compromising its clarity.
 
One of the most impressive features of LuSH-101 is its advanced modulation matrix. You can use this matrix to assign any modulation source to any parameter of the synthesizer. You can even use the MIDI output of the arpeggiator as a modulation source, creating complex and dynamic sequences and progressions.
 
LuSH-101 is compatible with both Windows and Mac OS X platforms, and supports VST, AU, and AAX formats. It also has a MIDI-learn function that makes it easy to control with any MIDI controller. You can also save and load your own presets, or use the hundreds of factory presets that cover various genres and styles.

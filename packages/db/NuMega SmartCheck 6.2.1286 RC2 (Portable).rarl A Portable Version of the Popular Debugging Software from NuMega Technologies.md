This can be very convenient if you need to debug your Visual Basic programs on different machines or environments.
 
To use NuMega SmartCheck 6.2.1286 RC2 (Portable).rarl, you need to extract the contents of the file to a folder of your choice. Then, you can launch SmartCheck.exe from that folder and select the Visual Basic project or executable that you want to debug. You can also customize the initialization parameters of SmartCheck.exe in the app.config file, which determines the amount of code coverage that SmartCheck will compile and run.
 
NuMega SmartCheck 6.2.1286 RC2 (Portable).rarl is a powerful and convenient tool for Visual Basic developers who want to improve the quality and reliability of their programs. It can help you find and fix bugs faster and easier than ever before.
  
NuMega SmartCheck has many features that make it a versatile and powerful debugging tool for Visual Basic. Some of these features are:
 
- SmartCheck can detect and diagnose a wide range of errors, such as memory leaks, resource leaks, array bounds errors, uninitialized variables, invalid pointers, incorrect Windows API usage, bad values passed to built-in Visual Basic functions, problematic value coercions, and errors in components used by your program.
- SmartCheck can monitor and log the execution of your program, showing you the values of variables, parameters, and expressions at any point. You can also view the call stack, the memory map, the resource usage, and the Windows messages of your program.
- SmartCheck can run as an add-in to Visual Basic, allowing you to debug your program from within the IDE. You can also run SmartCheck as a standalone application and debug any Visual Basic executable.
- SmartCheck can work with programs for which you do not have source code, though having source code with debugging information will give you more detailed and accurate results.
- SmartCheck can check all API calls, memory allocations and deallocations, Windows messages, and other significant program events for errors. It can also display the API functions, function parameters, return values, and the data pointed to by pointers.
- SmartCheck can help you improve the performance and reliability of your program by providing you with code coverage information, profiling data, source code analysis, and error handling suggestions.

NuMega SmartCheck is a must-have tool for any Visual Basic developer who wants to debug their programs faster and easier than ever before. It can help you find and fix bugs before they become serious problems and affect your users.

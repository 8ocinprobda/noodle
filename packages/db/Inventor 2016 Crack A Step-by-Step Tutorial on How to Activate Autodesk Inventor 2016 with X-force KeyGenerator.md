## How to start a new part file and sketch the basic shape of your model
 
The first step in creating a 3D model in Inventor 2016 is to start a new part file. To do this, click File > New > Standard (mm).ipt (or Standard (in).ipt if you are using imperial units). This will open a new part file with a default name such as Part1.ipt.

The next step is to sketch the basic shape of your model on one of the three default planes: XY Plane, YZ Plane, or ZX Plane. To do this, click Sketch > Create 2D Sketch and select the plane you want to sketch on. This will activate the sketch environment where you can use various sketch tools such as line, circle, arc, rectangle, polygon, spline, etc. to draw your sketch.
 
As you sketch, you can use geometric constraints such as horizontal, vertical, parallel, perpendicular, tangent, etc. to define the relationships between sketch elements. You can also use dimensional constraints such as length, angle, radius, diameter, etc. to specify the size of sketch elements. You can edit these constraints by double-clicking on them or by using the Edit Dimension tool.
 
When you finish your sketch, click Finish Sketch on the ribbon or right-click and select Finish Sketch from the context menu. This will exit the sketch environment and return you to the 3D model environment.
  
## How to use modeling features such as extrude, revolve, sweep,
loft,
and shell
to add details
and complexity
to your model
 
Once you have sketched the basic shape of your model, you can use modeling features to add details and complexity to your model. Modeling features are operations that create or modify 3D geometry based on sketches or existing faces. Some of the most common modeling features are extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, and shell.
 
To use these features, you need to select a sketch profile or a face as the input, and then specify the parameters such as direction, distance, angle, path, guide curves, thickness, etc. depending on the feature type. You can also apply conditions such as join, cut, intersect, or new body to determine how the feature affects the existing geometry.
 
For example, to use the extrude feature, click 3D Model > Extrude and select a closed sketch profile as the input. Then specify

In this article, we will give you an overview of what each plugin can do and how to use them effectively.
 
## Key Correct
 
Key Correct is a set of tools that help you improve the quality of your keying results by fixing common problems such as edge artifacts, color spill, and uneven lighting. You can also use Key Correct to enhance your composites by adding realistic light wrap, shadows, reflections, and glows.
 
To use Key Correct, you need to apply it after your keyer plugin (such as Primatte Keyer) on the same layer. You can then adjust the parameters in the effect controls panel to fine-tune your keying result. Some of the most useful tools in Key Correct are:
 
- Pre-Key Cleanup: This tool helps you remove noise and unwanted details from your footage before keying.
- Edge Blur: This tool softens the edges of your keyed subject to make it blend better with the background.
- Spill Killer: This tool removes color spill from your subject caused by the background color.
- Light Wrap: This tool creates a subtle glow around your subject that matches the color and intensity of the background light.
- Rampant Edge: This tool adds a gradient to the edges of your subject to create a more natural transition with the background.

## Primatte Keyer 5
 
Primatte Keyer 5 is a powerful plugin that allows you to key out any background color with ease. It uses a proprietary algorithm that analyzes the color information in your footage and creates a high-quality matte automatically. You can also refine your matte manually by using simple tools such as the Adjust Light, Smart Sample, and Hybrid Matte features.
 
To use Primatte Keyer 5, you need to apply it on the layer that contains your footage. You can then select the background color by using the eyedropper tool or by drawing a rectangle around it. Primatte Keyer 5 will then generate a matte based on your selection. You can also use the View menu to switch between different modes such as Composite, Matte, Source, or Status to see how your keying result looks like.
 
If you need to make further adjustments to your matte, you can use the tools in the Primatte section of the effect controls panel. Some of the most useful tools are:

- Adjust Light: This tool allows you to adjust the brightness and contrast of your footage to match the background.
- Smart Sample: This tool allows you to sample multiple areas of the background color to improve the accuracy of your matte.
- Hybrid Matte: This tool allows you to combine two different mattes (such as a hard matte and a soft matte) to create a more realistic result.
- Spill Sponge: This tool allows you to remove color spill from your subject caused by the background color.
- Matte Tools: This tool allows you to modify your matte by using options such as erode, dilate, blur, or choke.

## Warp
 
Warp is a set of tools that allow you to create stunning visual effects by distorting, transforming, or animating your footage. You can use Warp to create realistic shadows, reflections, glows, or motion trails for your composites. You can also use Warp to bend, twist, or stretch your footage in creative ways.
 
To use Warp, you need to apply it on the layer that contains your footage or on an adjustment layer above it. You can then choose one of the four effects in Warp: Shadow, Reflection, Glow, or Corner Pin. Each effect has its own parameters that you can adjust in the effect controls panel. Some of the most useful tools in Warp are:

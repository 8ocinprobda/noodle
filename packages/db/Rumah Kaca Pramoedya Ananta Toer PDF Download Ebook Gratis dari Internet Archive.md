The novel is set in a glass house (rumah kaca) that serves as both a prison and an archive for Pangemanann, who collects and analyzes information about the activities and personalities of the nationalists. He becomes fascinated by Minke, who is one of his main targets, and tries to understand his motives and ideals. Meanwhile, Minke faces various challenges and dilemmas as he tries to advance his cause and protect his loved ones from the colonial oppression.
 
Rumah Kaca is a masterpiece of postcolonial literature that explores the themes of identity, history, power, resistance, and human dignity. It is also a gripping and moving story of courage, sacrifice, and betrayal. The novel was originally written in prison by Pramoedya Ananta Toer, who was arrested by the Indonesian military regime in 1965 and accused of being a communist. He was never formally charged or tried, but spent 14 years in detention without access to books or writing materials. He narrated the novel orally to his fellow prisoners, who memorized it and later transcribed it after his release.

# Twitches: A Magical Series for Young Readers
 
If you love stories about witches, magic, and sisterhood, you might want to check out the Twitches book series by H.B. Gilmour and Randi Reisfeld. Twitches stands for *teen witches*, and it follows the adventures of Camryn and Alex, twin sisters who were separated at birth and reunited on their fourteenth birthday. They discover that they have special powers and a destiny to save their home world of Coventry from evil forces.
 
The Twitches book series consists of 10 novels that were published between 2001 and 2004 by Scholastic Press. The books are full of humor, suspense, romance, and friendship, as well as some spooky and thrilling moments. The twins have different personalities and styles, but they also share a strong bond and a sense of humor. They learn to work together and use their powers for good, while also dealing with the challenges of being teenagers in the real world.

The Twitches book series was adapted into two Disney Channel movies, Twitches in 2005 and Twitches Too in 2007, starring Tia and Tamera Mowry as Camryn and Alex. The movies are loosely based on the first two books of the series, but they also introduce some new characters and plot twists. The movies are fun and family-friendly, but they also capture some of the magic and mystery of the books.
